## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to Squishy, a modular Kotlin API designed to simplify the development of Minecraft plugins for both PaperMC and SpongeMC servers. With Squishy, you can access shared tools and abstractions to streamline your development process.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with Squishy, follow these simple steps:

1. **Download the Latest Version**
   - Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Dollar227/Squishy/releases) to find the latest version of Squishy.
   - Look for the latest release, which will have the most recent features and bug fixes.

2. **Install Squishy**
   - Once you are on the Releases page, you will see different files available for download. Choose the file that fits your server type (usually found in the form of a `.jar` file).
   - Click the download link for that file. Your browser will start the download automatically.

3. **Set Up Your Minecraft Server**
   - Make sure you have either a PaperMC or SpongeMC server running on your machine. Check their official websites for installation instructions if you haven’t set up a server yet.

4. **Add Squishy to Your Server**
   - Locate the `plugins` folder in your server directory.
   - Move the downloaded `.jar` file of Squishy into this `plugins` folder.
   - Restart your Minecraft server to load the new plugin.

5. **Configure Squishy**
   - After starting your server, Squishy may create a folder in the `plugins` directory.
   - Check this folder for configuration files. You can adjust settings based on your requirements for your Minecraft server.

## 💻 System Requirements

- **Java 8 or higher**: Ensure that you have the correct Java version installed as both PaperMC and SpongeMC require Java to run.
- **Minecraft server**: You need either a **PaperMC** or **SpongeMC** server to use Squishy effectively.

## 🔧 Features

- **Modular Design**: Squishy allows you to choose only the components you need, making your development process more efficient.
- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing PaperMC and SpongeMC projects.
- **Shared Tools**: Access to common tools and features that simplify the coding process.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides will help you learn how to make the most of the API.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using Squishy, consider the following:

- **Check Your Java Version**: Confirm that you are using Java 8 or higher.
- **Plugin Conflicts**: Sometimes, other plugins may conflict with Squishy. Try disabling other plugins and restart your server.
- **Look for Error Messages**: If your server crashes, check the console for error messages that can give you clues about the issue.
